  Over the last couple of years, I realized that life in a growing start-up inevitably had pushed me towards the Dev-Ops boundary. 
  
  Hence, I consider myself **somewhere between Dev and Ops**: Sometimes architecting cloud workloads, sometimes monitoring traffic and scaling activity, sometimes developing a fleet of IoT devices, and most importantly, *embracing lifelong learning*.
